# Bachelor of Arts

## General Graduation Requirements

1. **Courses**
	Students must take the equivalent of 35 St. Olaf credits through a combination of full-credit and fractional-credit courses.

	Note: For numerical purposes, the term "course" means a full (1.00) course credit, as distinguished from fractional course credits, unless otherwise noted.

2. **Residency Requirement**
	Seventeen of the 35 St. Olaf credits required for graduation must be taken through St. Olaf College. This may include St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus programs.

	The senior residency requirement consists of registration through St. Olaf either (a) during the last two semesters and Interim preceding the conferring of the degree or (b) for at least nine of the last 12 full-course credits. For instance, seniors may spend one of their last terms at another institution only if a maximum of three credits are applied to the St. Olaf degree. A senior may spend the final semester on a St. Olaf-sponsored off-campus program. See, however, PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT.

3. **January Interim**
	At least three of the required 35 St. Olaf credits must be earned in three separate January full-credit (1.0) Interims. An Interim may be taken on campus, through a St. Olaf off-campus Interim program, or through an approved Interim exchange with another 4-1-4 college. Transfer students admitted with at least sophomore standing must complete two Interims. After having successfully completed two Interims, senior participators may satisfy the third Interim requirement by means of a summer course taken during a St. Olaf summer session after the commencement in which the student participates.

4. **Grade Points and Grade Point Average**
	An average grade of C (2.00 on a 4.00 system) for all courses taken for the usual letter grades. See GRADE POINT AVERAGE for details.

5. **Course Level**
	Satisfactory completion of 18 credits above level I, courses numbered 200 and higher.

	A course can earn only its assigned level. It cannot be raised in level as the result of extra studies, assignments, or performance.

6. **Graded Courses**
	A minimum of 24 credits out of 35 must be taken graded through courses taken from a St. Olaf professor.

	A sliding scale is used if not all work is taken at St. Olaf or if credit is earned through special programs such as Advanced Placement. Sophomore transfer students need a minimum of 18 graded credits and junior transfer students a minimum of 13 graded credits. Details are available from the registrar.

	All students should be aware of the restrictions on S/U and P/N grades.

	Students studying on St. Olaf off-campus programs should refer to GRADED AND UNGRADED COURSES in the Academic Regulations section of this catalog for details about how this graduation requirement is affected by off-campus programs.

7. **Major — 8 or More Credits**
	One completed major is required for graduation. Depending on the department or interdisciplinary program, the number of courses required for a major ranges from eight to twelve courses, with some departments requiring course work in other departments. Departments and interdisciplinary programs may require comprehensive examinations or special research projects. (See Majors, Concentrations, and Areas of Emphasis.) Consult the department or interdisciplinary program listing in this catalog for specific major requirements. Students must declare one major no later than the time of registration for Interim and spring semester of their junior year by filling out a form available at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising. Students are allowed to change this declaration or add a second major at a later date. Only this catalog defines the specific requirements for each departmental or interdisciplinary major.

	Other regulations are:

    - Of the credits counting toward the minimum requirements for a major, a total of six (6.00) must be completed with a grade of C or higher.
	- Only one full-course equivalent (1.00-credit course) taken S/U may count toward the minimum requirements for a major. Some departments have more stringent regulations.
	- At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St. Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the appropriate department chair or program director about counting toward a major courses taken at other colleges. In addition to the registrar, the chair must sign the student’s transfer of credit form (available from the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other institutions is accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-campus programs must be approved by the chair or director and the off-campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major is sought. (See TRANSFER OF CREDIT TO ST. OLAF )
	- Certification of a completed major is the responsibility and prerogative of the department chair or program director, not the registrar.
	- See below, Credits Outside the Major.

	Multiple Majors:

	- Attaining two or three majors within the confines of 35 St. Olaf credits is often difficult. Students should consult frequently with their advisor and the chair or director of the major departments and programs. A graduate may add an additional major to the St. Olaf record if no more than two courses from another institution are subsequently applied to the additional major.

8. **Credits Outside the Major**
	While the maximum course credits counting toward a major in any one department may vary, 21 total full-course credits must be completed outside of the SIS "department" code of the major. The 21 total credits include Education Department courses attending the major. In order for a student to be certified in a second or third major, 21 credits also must be taken outside of the SIS "department" code of each of those majors as well. If a student has a double major, courses taken in one major count toward the 21 credits outside of the other major. Credits outside the major department or program include full- (1.00) credit courses plus partial - (.25, .50, .75) credit courses.

9. **Completion of Incomplete Grades**
	A student with an incomplete on his/her academic record may participate in Commencement if all other requirements for graduation have been met (see PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT). Only after a final grade has been recorded for the course, however, will a degree be conferred and a diploma issued.

10. **Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Music Double-Degree Option**
    Students must meet the application requirements for both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degree programs.

    Students engage in professional study in music and study in the liberal arts, leading to both Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Arts degrees.

    The duration of the double-degree option may vary among disciplines but will be less than the sum of the durations of both degree programs if undertaken separately. For most students, pursuit of a double-degree option will require five years of study. It should be noted that in a few cases (notably when the B.A. graduation major is in the natural sciences) completion of all requirements in five years may not be possible.

    Students pursuing the double-degree option may choose any of the five Bachelor of Music graduation majors (Church Music, Elective Studies, Music Education, Performance, and Theory/Composition) and any of the Bachelor of Arts graduation majors except Music.

    Students shall meet the requirements for the B.A. graduation major and B.M. graduation major, as well as the general education requirements and general graduation requirements for the two degrees. The final two years of coursework in pursuit of the degrees must be spent in residence. 17 of the last 20 full-course credits must be earned through St. Olaf. Some students may require up to 43 total credits in order to complete all requirements for both degrees.

    Students required to continue study in a fifth year to complete two degrees are eligible for continuing financial aid from St. Olaf College.

    A double-degree student may elect to graduate in two different semesters, one with each degree, but must meet all requirements for the degree and the graduation major within that degree before the diploma for that degree will be awarded.

    Graduating double-degree students receive two diplomas, one for each degree.

##  General Education Requirements

General education requirements constitute the core degree requirements of the curriculum. Courses are described in this catalog; general education attributes for all courses are indicated in the class and lab schedule.

St. Olaf’s general education curriculum does not work by a distribution system (so many courses in certain disciplines); rather, it identifies an area of learning for general education and sets out a series of guidelines and intended learning outcomes that inform the construction of courses. Departments and programs submit their course proposals to the Curriculum Committee, which judges whether a course fulfills a specific general education requirement. Because the college’s expectations for general education are distinctive and characteristic of St. Olaf College alone, students must be particularly careful as they plan off-campus and transfer work. The Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising determines how transfer work applies to St. Olaf’s general education requirements; advisors of approved St. Olaf programs determine whether a course taken through one of these programs/approved by St. Olaf applies to the general education requirements. See TRANSFER OF CREDIT TO ST. OLAF.

Some courses in the St. Olaf curriculum count for more than one graduation requirement at the same time. For example, a course taken for general education may also be the first course in a major. A course may simultaneously satisfy two different general education requirements. In addition, students may complete some requirements with approved courses taken on St. Olaf-approved international and off-campus programs.

Of courses taken to meet general education requirements, only .25 credit courses may be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) basis. Full or .50 credit courses taken S/U do not fulfill general education requirements.

An independent study or an independent research credit does not fulfill a general education requirement for the degree. Exception: In consultation with the faculty supervisor and with the approval of the registrar, independent study or independent research may count as a course in writing [WRI].

### FOUNDATION STUDIES

- First-Year Writing [FYW] -- 1 course
	First-year students are required to complete First-Year Writing (FYW), with two exceptions:

    - FYW is awarded to first-year students who receive a score of 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) English Literature or English Language Exam or a score of 5 or higher on the International Baccalaureate (IB) exam.
    - Students who initially transfer 15 or more courses to St. Olaf are exempt from the FYW requirement. 

	Students who may benefit from a two-semester sequence of writing instruction complete Writing 107: Introduction to Academic Writing, or Writing 110: Critical Skills in Composition, in the first semester of the first year, then complete a Writing 111 in the second semester of the first year. All other students may enroll directly in a Writing 111 section.

- Writing in Context Courses [WRI] -- 4 courses in any departments/programs

- Foreign Language [FOL] -- 0-4 courses
	- Requirement: All St. Olaf students must satisfy the foreign language requirement. Bachelor of Arts students must satisfactorily complete the fourth college semester course (numbered 232 or higher) taught in the French, German, or Spanish languages; or the third college semester course (numbered 231 or higher) taught in the Chinese, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Norwegian, or Russian languages, or demonstrate equivalent proficiency.

	- Languages not taught at St. Olaf: If new matriculating students or new transfer students wish to complete their FOL requirement with courses in a language not taught at St. Olaf, including American Sign Language (ASL), the course(s) must comply with college policy for completion of the FOL requirement, as determined by the registrar. Students planning to fulfill the foreign language requirement with transfer courses from other institutions should be aware of St. Olaf’s requirement of intermediate proficiency in one foreign language (including American Sign Language [ASL]). Questions regarding the transfer of foreign language courses to St. Olaf should be directed in advance to the registrar.

	- Alternative route: In very rare cases, the foreign language requirement may be fulfilled by another method: students who have not fulfilled the foreign language requirement may petition the Foreign Language Subcommittee of the Curriculum Committee to satisfy the remainder of the requirement by completing one or more substitute courses in foreign culture and civilization or in literature in English translation. In compliance with state and federal disability discrimination laws, this alternative route to fulfillment of the foreign language requirement is intended for students with disabilities specific to the learning of foreign languages. Any petition should be drawn up with the guidance of the Academic Support Center.

- Oral Communication [ORC] – 1 course

- Abstract and Quantitative Reasoning [AQR] – 1 course
	Placement: The Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department recommends courses for students to take based on their responses to the Mathematics/Statistics and Computer Science placement surveys. Students who do not need to take calculus for their major may want to wait until at least their sophomore year before deciding which mathematics, statistics, or computer science course is the best option for them to take to satisfy the AQR requirement.

- Studies in Physical Movement [SPM] – 2 courses (of any credit value)
	Additional Information:

	Two different courses, of any credit value, that expand students' experiences in and understanding of movement and promote lifelong health and wellness of the whole person. Students are encouraged to expland their horizons and focus on different activities or modes of movement in order to fulfill the requirements.

	It is strongly recommended that both SPM requirements be completed before the senior year. The following regulations are often misunderstood:

    - If students do not appear on the first class day of an SPM course, the instructor normally assumes that the student will drop the course. In this event, the student must still officially drop the course at the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising by the posted drop deadline. The instructor does not assume this responsibility.

    - Only one SPM course credit may be earned by students as a result of participation in an approved intercollegiate sport. This credit must be entered as Exercise Science 171-194 at the registration preceding the sport/participation term. Credit cannot be claimed after the term in which participation took place unless the student completes a petition form; a late fee is assessed. An intercollegiate SPM (.25) credit can only be used within the two-course SPM graduation requirement. An intercollegiate SPM (.25) credit cannot be used as an elective for the purpose of earning a credit toward the 35 full-credit course requirement for graduation. It can only be used once as one half of the two-course SPM requirement.

    - At registration, students may register initially for only one SPM course. On a space-available basis a second SPM course may be added during the same term with a signed drop/add slip within the drop/add dates published on the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising Web site.
    
    After the two-course SPM requirement has been completed, students may repeat a specific exercise science activity (ESAC) course under the following conditions:

    - The SPM requirement is completed with two different courses.
    - Students repeating an ESAC course must wait until the first day of classes to register the repeated activity course, to allow all current students to register for SPM courses.
    - Students may only register on a “space available” (open courses) basis.
    - Each specific exercise science activity course may only be taken a maximum of four times (the first time plus three repeats).

### CORE STUDIES
- Historical Studies in Western Culture [HWC] – 2 courses in any departments/programs
- Multicultural Studies [MCG, MCD] – 2 courses, one MCG, one MCD (must be from two different departments/programs)

	- Students who initially transfer 15 or more courses to St. Olaf are required to complete only the Christian theology (BTS-T) course.
	- One BTS-T course is the required prerequisite for an EIN course.
- Studies in Natural Science:
	- Scientific Exploration and Discovery [SED] – 1 course (SED, IST must be completed with two different courses from two different departments/programs)
	- Integrated Scientific Topics [IST] – 1 course (SED, IST must be completed with two different courses from two different departments/programs)
